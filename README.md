# Simple Photo Manager API

My first small project, as a beginner, building Backend API with Golang

## Depedencies

- [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm)
- [jwt-go](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt)
- [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt)
- [godotenv](https://github.com/lpernett/godotenv)
- [go-mysql driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)

## Extra Dependency for Local Development

- [CompileDaemon](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon)

## Functionalities

1. User registration and login
2. User authorization using JWT
3. Basic photo manager (upload, edit, and delete)
